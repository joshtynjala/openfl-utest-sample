# Using UTest with OpenFL Sample

Automated tests created with [utest](https://lib.haxe.org/p/utest) for an [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) project.

To run the tests, use the `openfl test` command with one of OpenFL's supported target platforms. For example, to run tests in a web browser use the following command:

```sh
openfl test html5
```
